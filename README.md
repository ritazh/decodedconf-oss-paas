# Decoded Conference Session - Host Your Own Open Source Heroku

**Live Presentation**: 

Whether you are a startup or an enterprise, you want happy and productive developers. Using containers, git, and orchestrators, you can now host and manage your own open source platforms similar to Heroku across clusters of machines for your organization. This providers self-service features to developers so they can focus on building awesome apps instead of worrying about infrastructure, while it removes dependencies on Heroku.
